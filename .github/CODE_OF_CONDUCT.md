# Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct

## Our Commitment

To foster an open, welcoming, and inclusive environment, we as contributors and maintainers commit to ensuring that participation in our project and community is harassment-free for everyone. This includes individuals of all ages, body types, abilities, ethnicities, gender identities and expressions, levels of experience, education, socio-economic backgrounds, nationalities, personal appearances, races, religions, sexual orientations, or any other characteristic.

## Our Standards

We strive to create a positive, respectful, and constructive community. Examples of behavior that contribute to this include:

- Using welcoming and inclusive language.
- Respecting diverse perspectives and experiences.
- Accepting constructive feedback gracefully.
- Prioritizing the community's best interests.
- Demonstrating empathy and kindness toward others.

Unacceptable behaviors that do not align with these values include but are not limited to:

- Using sexualized language, imagery, or unwelcome sexual advances.
- Engaging in trolling, insults, or personal and political attacks.
- Harassing others publicly or privately.
- Publishing private information (e.g., physical or email addresses) without explicit consent.
- Acting in any way deemed inappropriate in a professional or community setting.

## Our Responsibilities

Project maintainers are responsible for clearly defining acceptable behavior and enforcing these standards consistently and fairly. They are empowered to:

- Edit, delete, or reject comments, commits, code, or contributions that violate this Code of Conduct.
- Take temporary or permanent action against individuals for inappropriate, threatening, or harmful behavior.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies to all project spaces, including official channels like forums, repositories, and social media accounts. It also extends to public interactions where individuals represent the project or community, such as conferences, events, or online discussions.

Project maintainers may further clarify what constitutes project representation and ensure that guidelines are well understood.

## Enforcement

If you experience or witness abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior, please report it by contacting the project team. All reports will be reviewed promptly, thoroughly, and confidentially.

The project team will respond appropriately to the situation, which may include:
- Taking corrective action.
- Communicating outcomes with the affected parties.
- Enforcing temporary or permanent sanctions as necessary.

Maintainers who fail to uphold or enforce this Code of Conduct in good faith may face repercussions as determined by the projectâ€™s leadership team.
